# Clothing Swap Platform Icon

This directory should contain the module icon.

Place an icon.png file (128x128 pixels) here to represent the module in the Odoo apps list.

The icon should be:
- 128x128 pixels
- PNG format
- Professional looking
- Related to clothing/fashion/swapping theme

You can create an icon with:
- A clothing hanger symbol
- Circular arrows (representing swapping)
- Clothing items
- Fashion-related imagery

For now, this serves as a placeholder until you add your custom icon.
